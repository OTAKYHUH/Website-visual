  <div class="section-title">Introduction</div>
  <p>
    The container terminal operates round-the-clock and the Automated Yard Duty Manager (aYDM) manages
    the terminal yard operations during shift. The Replanner (RP) assist the aYDM by ensuring that yard
    operations within section are carried out smoothly, efficiently and safely whilst meeting Operational
    targets. Important RP targets include ensuring good Prime Move (PM) productivity via good yard waiting time.
  </p>

  <div class="section-title">Objective</div>
  <p>The objective of this OJT programme is to enable the RP to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Familiarize himself with the roles and responsibilities of the RP</li>
    <li>To learn and understand the skills required for him to function effectively and independently in his role as an RP</li>
    <li>To be aware of the operational situations faced in the Container Terminal and how to make correct decisions to achieve the best yard performance possible</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="section-title">Tasks</div>
  <p>
    During his training programme, the trainee will observe his mentor carrying out his RP duties, which can include the following:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Monitoring of yard service level and productivity</li>
    <li>Monitoring and minimizing yard congestion <span class="no-wrap">(RTGs, ARMGs)</span></li>
    <li>Handling common yard exceptions</li>
    <li>Execute smooth shift changeover</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    With guidance from his Shift Mentor, he should use the guidelines / knowledge checklist to gauge the extent of his knowledge gained.
    RP should prepare himself to perform the role independently in the future by asking questions actively during OJT to better equip himself
    with the required skills.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Section AM will review his assignments and assess his understanding using the Guidelines / Knowledge Checklist. The complete Task Book
    will be used as a record to determine if the trainee has attained the necessary competencies.
